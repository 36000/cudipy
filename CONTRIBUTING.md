# Contributing to cuDIPY

cuDIPY is an open-source software project, and we have an open development
process. This means that we welcome contributions from anyone. We do ask that
you first read this document and follow the guidelines we have outlined here and
that you follow the [NIPY community code of conduct](http://nipy.org/conduct.html).

## Getting started

If you are looking for places that you could make a meaningful contribution,
please contact us! We respond to queries on the [Nipy mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/neuroimaging), and to questions
on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/dipy/dipy). A good place to get an
idea for things that currently need attention is the
[issues](https://github.com/dipy/cudipy/issues) page of our Github repository.
This page collects outstanding issues that you can help address. Join the
conversation about the issue, by typing into the text box in the issue page.

## The development process

cuDIPY does not currently have independent develpment guidelines. Please refer
to the DIPY's [development guidelines](https://dipy.org/documentation/latest/devel/).
